## Below is a small collection of photos/screenshots I collected throughout my time at EV Underground, and in this post in particular, showing off the design and fabrication process of the custom drive unit mount for a Porsche 356 EV conversion. 

#### In the first few photos you can see the mount in-situe using a 3D scan of the "Tesla Small Rear Drive Unit" and engine compartment from the 356, as well as a combination of other custom and off the shelf components using Fusion 360.

#### A key component of low volume production, such as in the case of one-off EV conversions, is managing costs. An effective way to do so is to design with manufacturing and fabrication simplicity in mind. This entire design is comprised of 1-1/2" x 0.120" Wall 1026 DOM Tubing, CNC Bent, and water jet and bent 11ga A1008 steel.

#### This allowed us to order all the components from Send-Cut-Send and a local vendor, and complete final fabrication in house and at a low cost.

#### I was quite impressed with the fitment of my tab and slot design on this part of the project, it made for easy assembly and fabrication. Please see "Chassis Bracket Design & Simulation" for more details on this component.

#### Once everything is all tac'd up, the mount can be removed from the car and final welding completed!

#### There was still a lot that needed to be sorted out with this project by the time I left the company, however much of the design ground work is there, and I hope this car sees the road in the near future!
