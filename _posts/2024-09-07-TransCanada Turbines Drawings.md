# Redacted Drawings

#### Below is a collection of a few of the drawings I created during my internship at TransCanada Turbines Ltd.

#### For non-disclosure purposes, some of the information is redacted, and I cannot share certain information regarding the application, however, these should provide some insight into my experience with design and drafting using SolidWorks.

_TCT5340 - Universal Shaker Table Adapter_

#### This design and drawing are a revision on a previous intern's work, simply intended to expand the application of the tool to a broader range of accelerometers used on GE and Siemens engines.

<br>

_TCT5683 - Fuel Manifold Turnover Stand_

#### A relatively simple design based on other tooling commonly used in turbine maintainance, often simply called a turnover stand, to allow technicians safe and easy access to fuel manifolds after removal from the engine. This was also my first drawing to include welding symbol callouts... perhaps you can tell.

_TCT5690 - F11 Gearbox Immobilizer_

<br>

<embed src="/assets/pdfs/Engineering Drawings/TCT5691.pdf"  width="100%" height="650" type="application/pdf">
_TCT5691 - F12 Gearbox Immobilizer (FWD)_

<br>

<embed src="/assets/pdfs/Engineering Drawings/TCT5695.pdf"  width="100%" height="650" type="application/pdf">
_TCT5695 - F12 Gearbox Immobilizer (AFT)_

#### The three previous drawings depict tools used in the dismantling of the accessory and starter gearboxes. TCT5690 required specifications for the spline feature, so I got to experience first-hand the critical dimensions and manufacturing complications associated with such complex mating interfaces.

<br>

_TCT5702 - Avon Compressor Shaft Storage Crate_

#### TCT has clients all over the world, and as such, delicate and expensive components need to be shipped globally, sometimes experiencing less than ideal transport conditions. I had way too much fun designing this unusually high precision and protective wooden shipping crate! 

<br>

<embed src="/assets/pdfs/Engineering Drawings/TCT5706.pdf"  width="100%" height="640" type="application/pdf">
_TCT5706 - HPC Stage 3 Disc Lifter_

#### Not much to be said about this one. Sometimes a job needs doing, and the solution doesn't need to be expensive or flashy. I did make good use of my favourite manufacturing method here. Water Jet is King!!

<br>

<embed src="/assets/pdfs/Engineering Drawings/TCT5709.pdf"  width="100%" height="1050" type="application/pdf">
_TCT5709 - RB211 CRF Mid-Flang Bolt Board_

#### Super simple and cheap, but the technicians appreciated immensely the ability to keep track of their bolts during teardown.

<br>

<embed src="/assets/pdfs/Engineering Drawings/TCT5715.pdf"  width="100%" height="540" type="application/pdf">
_TCT5715 - [REDACTED]_

#### I cannot reveal much about this tooling, however, I share it because it conveys my familiarity with tight tolerances and a bit of GD&T. I also took the time to quite accurately model a "Curvic Coupling" (Item 1) based on one used in the engine this tooling is designed for, for no other reason than to challenge my SolidWorls skills.

_TCT5721 - RB Build Platform Work Surface_

#### Another simple but appreciated addition to improve technician workflow. These were intended to be a bolt on addition to any of our various "build stands" to provide more table/bench space (rated to 250lbs).

_TCT5728 - LM2500 CFF Pressure Test Fixture Addition_

#### This design posed a few challenges with regard to fitment after welding, however, once that was sorted the tool worked as intended and is still in service at the time of posting this. This was also my first experience spec'ing o-rings and designing corresponding grooves for a pressure fit.
