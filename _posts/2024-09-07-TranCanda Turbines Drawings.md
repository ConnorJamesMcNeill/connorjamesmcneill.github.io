# Redacted Drawings

### Below is a collection of a few of the drawings I created during my internship at TransCanada Turbines Ltd.

### For non-disclosure purposes, some of the information is redacted, and I cannot share certain information regarding the application, however, these should provide some insight into my experience with design and drafting using SolidWorks.
