### This was an interesting and challenging project for me. I drove 3 hrs to Sparwood B.C., with my 2002 Duramax and a U-Haul trailer to purchase this 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 

### I found the vehicle in the local classifieds knowing the vehicle did not run. I ahdn't realized that this would make for an interesting time loading the vehicle onto the trailer, on snow covered ground. 

### However, a second truck, tow ropes, a snatch block, and some manual labour had me loaded up and back on the road in no time!!

### Once I got the vehicle home and unloaded, I was quickly able to determine, by manually turning the engine over at the crank pulley, that the engine was seized. I began tearing the engine down to see if the cause of the lock-up could be attributed to a seized component in the accessory drive system or valvetrain, however, upon removing the cylinder head it became apparent that cylinder #8 had experienced some catastrophic event resulting in a hole in the piston, potentially caused by a clogged fuel injector causing the cylinder to run lean and overheat. 

### While it would be possible to hone the cylinder bore and replace just the one piston, the potential for metal debris to be caught in the oiling system after an event like this is too high and would require substantial labour hours and parts.

### The exorbitant costs associated with an engine overhaul quickly ruled that out has a option. Fortunately however, I was able to source a second hand motor out of a 2009 Dodge Ram. This made for a mostly straight forward swap, and I was able to have the vehicle back up and running over the course of about a month, and sold it a few weeks later for a healthy profit!
